# Current project state

Last updated: 2026-09-18. Git root: D:/lap_trinh_game/cuoi_ky/game. Snapshot HEAD: 640658e; inspect current status every session.

## Goal and phase

Stabilize the university project's 3-wave MVP before adding Week 4/5 features. The reported difficulty, missing spawner reference, instant transitions, duplicate-hit risk and missing camera-follow implementation have now been addressed. Unity Play Mode regression passed; full-duration balance playtest and Windows build remain unverified.

## Implemented and saved

- GameScene remains the gameplay/build scene. Existing normalized WASD, mouse aim and continuous auto-fire are preserved.
- WaveManager owns a serialized WaveSettings array, editable directly in Inspector (not ScriptableObjects yet).
- Wave 1: 30 seconds, cap 10 living enemies, 10 HP each, spawn interval 1.5 seconds, speed 2 units/s.
- Wave 2: 30 seconds, cap 15, 20 HP, interval 1 second, speed 2.5 units/s.
- Wave 3: 45 seconds, cap 30, 30 HP, interval 0.6 seconds, speed 3 units/s.
- Counts are simultaneous living caps, NOT total enemies for a wave. Death frees a slot; spawning continues until time expires.
- Explicit WaveManager -> EnemySpawner and other manager references saved in GameScene.
- Wave 1/2 completion freezes combat and shows WAVE COMPLETE for 2 real seconds; then the next wave starts automatically.
- Old enemies and bullets are deactivated/destroyed at transitions and terminal outcomes. Player HP and position persist across waves; no free healing.
- Final completion uses Victory state / ALL WAVES COMPLETE. Death uses Game Over. Both allow PLAY AGAIN.
- Enemy initialization sets absolute HP/speed, including the placed scene enemy; no multiplier switch or compounded scaling.
- Bullet guards its first accepted hit before damage/Destroy. Circle trigger remains enabled; redundant Box trigger disabled in saved prefab, retained for recovery.
- CameraFollow on Main Camera tracks Player XY in LateUpdate, preserving camera Z. Spawning uses outside-camera positions, margin 1 and minimum Player distance 3.
- Player movement is intentionally unbounded for now: camera follows, no invented wall/map rectangle.

## Checks actually executed

- Runtime scripts compiled with Roslyn against project Unity assemblies: exit 0; Inspector-field CS0649 warnings only.
- Unity Editor imported/compiled changes and saved scene/prefab via Tools > Brotato > Apply Combat Setup.
- Ran Tools > Brotato > Run Combat Regression in actual Unity Play Mode: ALL CHECKS PASSED.
- Confirmed serialized references, all 3 durations/intervals, living caps 10/15/30, HP/speed on spawned enemies, spawn positions outside camera and replacement after a kill.
- Real Physics2D overlap with BOTH bullet colliders temporarily enabled did exactly 10 damage; explicitly repeating callback also did one hit only. Enemy HP clamps to zero.
- Camera followed a displaced Player and retained Z; Player hit cooldown blocked a consecutive hit.
- Timer expiry -> 2-second intermission -> next wave; cleanup/freeze, preserved/protected HP, final Victory, lethal HP zero -> Game Over.
- Restart method used by PLAY AGAIN successfully reloaded scene after both results, resetting wave/timer/HP/timeScale and controls.
- No gameplay runtime errors during the regression; final Console showed zero errors/warnings.
- Reusable Editor-only test: Assets/Editor/CombatRegression.cs. Local detailed result: Temp/CombatRegression.txt (generated/ignored, not source).

## Verification limits / next steps

1. Play an ordinary full-duration 30/30/45-second round to assess difficulty, moving/aiming feel and camera-follow feel. Automated tests shorten timers and force spawn scheduling to exercise caps; they are not a human balance playtest.
2. Build/test Windows executable; not done in this session.
3. Arena boundaries are still unspecified. Current choice is free movement + following camera; don't invent map limits without design.
4. When requested, migrate inline WaveSettings to reusable WaveData ScriptableObjects. Keep current values/transition policy unless user changes them.
5. Only then proceed to Kill Count / gun upgrades and further content at user's request.

## Important paths and setup

- Assets/Scenes/GameScene.unity: main scene, saved wave values and camera/spawner wiring.
- Assets/Scripts/Core/{GameManager,CameraFollow}.cs: game state/UI/retry and camera.
- Assets/Scripts/Wave/WaveManager.cs: timer, inline settings, unscaled intermission.
- Assets/Scripts/Enemy/{EnemySpawner,EnemyController,EnemyHealth,EnemyContactDamage}.cs: spawning, absolute stats, pursuit, contact.
- Assets/Scripts/Player/{PlayerController,PlayerHealth}.cs and Weapon/{WeaponAim,Bullet}.cs: controls/combat.
- Assets/Editor/CombatSetup.cs: one-time setup helper. Reapplying it resets wave tuning to this request's defaults; not needed on every launch.
- Player weapon hierarchy remains scene-added, not fully inside Player prefab.
- OnGUI is prototype UI; no finished Canvas/main menu/pause/items/upgrades yet.

## Git handoff

Pre-existing user changes in scene/prefabs/scripts/build settings/docs were preserved. This session additionally changes combat scripts, Bullet prefab, GameScene and documentation and adds CameraFollow and Editor helpers with Unity-generated .meta files. No commit or push was performed. Include all intended source/.meta/docs changes when sharing; exclude Library, Temp and Logs.
